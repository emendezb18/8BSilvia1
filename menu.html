<h2>Why did the Cold War start?</h2>
<p class="parrafo2">The war started because of the rivalry between the US and the USSR.  First the US and the USSR both had the same objective, taking down Hitler and the Nazi party. This event made the two countries ally in 1942 until 1945 when the Nazi party was taken down. After this war they became rivals because of the political disagreements. The US had a capitalsim system and the Soviet Union was communist. After the fighting, the political borders changed completely, it went from one union to new countries.

<h2>Countries involved in the War</h2>
<p>When the Cold war started, the US joined and so did his allies. The countries who joined were the ones who were in NATO, which were, all Brussels treaty nations, Canada, Denmark, Iceland, Italy, Norway and Portugal. More countries were invited to the union but they denied. In response to NATO, the Soviet Union concluded a military defense known as the Warsaw Pact with Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland, and Romania. In 1975, The Warsaw Pact was considered to be superior from NATO, but they were both sustainable in Asia and in the Pacific. This event lead to unbalanced powers in different regions across the globe. After the cold war both the United states and Russia lost territory and nuclear stockpiles.
